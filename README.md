## Installation

_Note_: React ProseMirror releases are coupled to specific prosemirror-view
releases, and are not guaranteed to work with other versions of
prosemirror-view. Ensure that your version of prosemirror-view matches the
version in React ProseMirror's peer dependencies!

_Note_: React ProseMirror does not require a specific version of React, React
DOM, or React Reconciler. **However**, you must ensure that your React
Reconciler version matches your React/React DOM versions.

| React version   | React Reconciler version |
| --------------- | ------------------------ |
| 19.x            | 0.32.0                   |
| >= 18.2.0, < 19 | 0.29.0                   |
| 18.1.x          | 0.28.0                   |
| 18.0.x          | 0.27.0                   |
| 17.x            | 0.26.1                   |

npm:

```sh
npm install @handlewithcare/react-prosemirror \
    react@^19.1.0 \
    react-dom@^19.1.0 \
    react-reconciler@0.32.0 \
    prosemirror-view@1.42.3 \
    prosemirror-state \
    prosemirror-model
```

yarn:

```sh
yarn add @handlewithcare/react-prosemirror \
    react@^19.1.0 \
    react-dom@^19.1.0 \
    react-reconciler@0.32.0 \
    prosemirror-view@1.42.3 \
    prosemirror-state \
    prosemirror-model
```

_Note_: React ProseMirror needs the prosemirror-view stylesheet just as a
vanilla ProseMirror set up would. How this stylesheet gets imported can vary
based on the application, but may be as simple as:

```css
/* editor.css */
@import "prosemirror-view/style/prosemirror.css";
```

Or:

```ts
// Editor.tsx
import "prosemirror-view/style/prosemirror.css";
```

integration? Check out [the Tiptap integration docs](./src/tiptap/README.md)!

## The Problem

To make updates efficient, React separates updates into phases so that it can
process updates in batches. In the first phase, application code renders a
virtual document. In the second phase, the React DOM renderer finalizes the
update by reconciling the real document with the virtual document.

On the other hand, the ProseMirror View library renders ProseMirror documents in
a single-phase update. Unlike React, it also allows built-in editing features of
the browser to modify the document under some circumstances, deriving state
updates from view updates rather than the other way around.

It is possible to use both React DOM and ProseMirror View, but using React DOM
to render ProseMirror View components safely requires careful consideration of
differences between the rendering approaches taken by each framework. The first
phase of a React update should be free of side effects, which requires that
updates to the ProseMirror View happen in the second phase. This means that
during the first phase, React components actually have access to a different
(newer) version of the EditorState than the one in the EditorView. As a result
code that dispatches transactions may dispatch transactions based on incorrect
state. Code that invokes methods of the ProseMirror view may make bad
assumptions about its state that cause incorrect behavior or errors.

It's also challenging to effectively use React to define node views for
ProseMirror documents. Both ProseMirror and React expect to have full control
over their respective parts of the DOM. They both modify and destroy DOM nodes
as needed. Previous solutions (including previous iterations of this library)
have attempted to work around this power struggle by producing wrapper elements
to hand to ProseMirror, and then mounting React nodes within these (usually with
React Portals).

This approach works, but tenuously. Having additional nodes in the document that
ProseMirror isn't strictly aware of can cause issues with its change detection
system, leading to challenging edge cases.
[Here's an example](https://github.com/nytimes/react-prosemirror/issues/42).
These extra wrapping elements also make it challenging to produce semantic
markup and introduce challenges when styling.

## The Solution

This library provides an alternate implementation of ProseMirror's EditorView.
It uses React as the rendering engine, rather than ProseMirror's home-brewed DOM
update system. This allows us to provide a more comfortable integration with
ProseMirror's powerful data model, transformations, and event management
systems.

### Rendering ProseMirror Views within React

This library provides a set of React contexts and hooks for consuming them that
ensure safe access to the EditorView from React components. This allows us to
build React applications that contain ProseMirror Views, even when the
EditorState is lifted into React state, or a global state management system like
Redux.

The simplest way to make use of these contexts is with the `<ProseMirror />`
component. The `<ProseMirror />` component can be used controlled (via the
`state` prop) or uncontrolled (via the `defaultState` prop).

```tsx
import { EditorState } from "prosemirror-state";
import {
  ProseMirror,
  ProseMirrorDoc,
  reactKeys,
} from "@handlewithcare/react-prosemirror";

export function ProseMirrorEditor() {
  return (
    <ProseMirror
      defaultState={EditorState.create({
        schema,
        plugins: [
          // The reactKeys plugin is required for the ProseMirror component to work!
          reactKeys(),
        ],
      })}
    >
      <ProseMirrorDoc />
    </ProseMirror>
  );
}
```

The EditorState can also easily be lifted out of the ProseMirror component and
passed as a prop.

```tsx
import { EditorState } from "prosemirror-state";
import { schema } from "prosemirror-schema-basic";
import {
  ProseMirror,
  ProseMirrorDoc,
  reactKeys,
} from "@handlewithcare/react-prosemirror";

export function ProseMirrorEditor() {
  const [editorState, setEditorState] = useState(
    EditorState.create({ schema, plugins: [reactKeys()] })
  );

  return (
    <ProseMirror
      state={editorState}
      dispatchTransaction={(tr) => {
        setEditorState((s) => s.apply(tr));
      }}
    >
      <ProseMirrorDoc />
    </ProseMirror>
  );
}
```

The `EditorView` interface exposes several useful methods that provide access to
the DOM or data derived from its layout, such as `coordsFromPos`. These methods
should only be accessed outside the render cycle, to ensure that the DOM has
been updated to match the latest state. React ProseMirror provides two hooks to
enable this access pattern: `useEditorEffect` and `useEditorEventCallback`. Both
of these hooks can be used from any children of the ProseMirror component.

#### `useEditorEffect`

Often, it's necessary to position React components relative to specific
positions in the ProseMirror document. For example, you might have some widget
that needs to be positioned at the user's cursor. In order to ensure that this
positioning happens when the DOM is in sync with the latest EditorState, we can
use `useEditorEffect`.

```tsx
// SelectionWidget.tsx
import { useRef } from "react";
import { useEditorEffect } from "@handlewithcare/react-prosemirror";

export function SelectionWidget() {
  const ref = useRef();

  useEditorEffect((view) => {
    if (!view || !ref.current) return;

    const viewClientRect = view.dom.getBoundingClientRect();
    const coords = view.coordsAtPos(view.state.selection.anchor));

    ref.current.style.top = coords.top - viewClientRect.top;
    ref.current.style.left = coords.left - viewClientRect.left;
  })

  return (
    <div
      ref={ref}
      style={{
        position: "absolute"
      }}
    />
  );
}

// ProseMirrorEditor.tsx
import {
  ProseMirror,
  ProseMirrorDoc,
  reactKeys
} from "@handlewithcare/react-prosemirror";
import { EditorState } from "prosemirror-state";
import { schema } from "prosemirror-schema-basic";

import { SelectionWidget } from "./SelectionWidget.tsx";

export function ProseMirrorEditor() {
  const [editorState, setEditorState] = useState(
    EditorState.create({ schema, plugins: [reactKeys()] })
  );

  return (
    <ProseMirror
      state={editorState}
      dispatchTransaction={(tr) => {
        setEditorState(s => s.apply(tr))
      }}
    >
      <ProseMirrorDoc />
      {/*
        We have to mount all components that need to access the
        EditorView as children of the ProseMirror component
      */}
      <SelectionWidget />
    </ProseMirror>
  );
}
```

#### `useEditorEventCallback`

It's also often necessary to dispatch transactions or execute side effects in
response to user actions, like mouse clicks and keyboard events.

You can use `useEditorEventCallback` to create a stable function reference that
can safely access the latest value of the `EditorView`.

_Note_: if you need to respond to keyboard events from _within_ the
`contenteditable` element, you should instead use
[`useEditorEventListener`](#useEditorEventListener).

```tsx
// BoldButton.tsx
import { toggleMark } from "prosemirror-commands";
import { useEditorEventCallback } from "@handlewithcare/react-prosemirror";

export function BoldButton() {
  const onClick = useEditorEventCallback((view) => {
    if (!view) return;
    const toggleBoldMark = toggleMark(view.state.schema.marks.bold);
    toggleBoldMark(view.state, view.dispatch, view);
  });

  return <button onClick={onClick}>Bold</button>;
}

// ProseMirrorEditor.tsx
import {
  ProseMirror,
  ProseMirrorDoc,
  reactKeys,
} from "@handlewithcare/react-prosemirror";
import { EditorState } from "prosemirror-state";
import { schema } from "prosemirror-schema-basic";

import { BoldButton } from "./BoldButton.tsx";

export function ProseMirrorEditor() {
  const [editorState, setEditorState] = useState(
    EditorState.create({ schema, plugins: [reactKeys()] })
  );

  return (
    <ProseMirror
      state={editorState}
      dispatchTransaction={(tr) => {
        setEditorState((s) => s.apply(tr));
      }}
    >
      <ProseMirrorDoc />
      {/*
        We have to mount all components that need to access the
        EditorView as children of the ProseMirror component
      */}
      <BoldButton />
    </ProseMirror>
  );
}
```

#### `useEditorEventListener`

`useEditorEventCallback` produces functions that can be passed to React
components as event handlers. If you need to listen to events that originate
_within the `contenteditable` node_, however, those event listeners need to be
registered with the `EditorView`'s `handleDOMEvents` prop.

You can use the `useEditorEventListener` hook to accomplish this. It takes an
`eventType` and an event listener. The event listener follows the usual
semantics for ProseMirror's `handleDOMEvents` prop:

- Returning `true` or calling `event.preventDefault` will prevent other
  listeners from running.
- Returning `true` will not automatically call `event.preventDefault`; if you
  want to prevent the default contenteditable behavior, you must call
  `event.preventDefault`.

You can use this hook to implement custom behavior in your node views:

```tsx
import {
  useEditorEventListener,
  NodeViewComponentProps,
  useMergedDOMRefs,
} from "@handlewithcare/react-prosemirror";

function Paragraph({ children, nodeProps, ref, ...props }) {
  useEditorEventListener("keydown", (view, event) => {
    const { pos, node } = nodeProps;

    if (event.code !== "ArrowDown") {
      return false;
    }
    const nodeEnd = pos + node.nodeSize;
    const { selection } = view.state;
    if (selection.anchor < pos || selection.anchor > nodeEnd) {
      return false;
    }
    event.preventDefault();
    alert("No down keys allowed!");
    return true;
  });

  return (
    <p {...props} ref={useMergedDOMRefs(ref, nodeProps.contentDOMRef)}>
      {children}
    </p>
  );
}
```

### Building node views with React

The other way to integrate React and ProseMirror is to have ProseMirror render
node views using React components. Because React ProseMirror renders the
ProseMirror document with React, node view components don't need to do anything
special other than fulfill the
[`NodeViewComponentProps`](#nodeviewcomponentprops) interface.

```tsx
import {
  ProseMirror,
  ProseMirrorDoc,
  useEditorEventCallback,
  NodeViewComponentProps,
  useMergedDOMRefs,
  reactKeys,
} from "@handlewithcare/react-prosemirror";
import { EditorState } from "prosemirror-state";
import { schema } from "prosemirror-schema-basic";

// Paragraph is more or less a normal React component, taking and rendering
// its children. Some guidelines:
//
//   - All node view components _must_ pass refs to their top-level
//     DOM elements.
//   - All node view components that render children _must_ pass nodeProps.contentDOMRef
//     to the parent element of `children`. If this is also the top-level DOM
//     element, use `useMergedDOMRefs` to apply both refs
//   - All node view components _should_ spread all of the props that they
//     receive onto their top-level DOM elements; this is required for node Decorations
//     that apply attributes rather than wrapping nodes in an additional element.
//
// Note: we are accessing `ref` as a prop here, which has been available since React 19.
// If you are using React <=18, you will need to use forwardRef to access `ref`.
function Paragraph({ children, nodeProps, ref, ...props }) {
  const onClick = useEditorEventCallback((view) =>
    view.dispatch(view.state.tr.deleteSelection())
  );

  return (
    <p
      {...props}
      ref={useMergedDOMRefs(ref, nodeProps.contentDOMRef)}
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      {children}
    </p>
  );
}

// **IMPORTANT**: Define nodeViewComponents _outside_ of your editor
// component. It should be a stable reference.
//
// If you need to define it within a React component for some reason,
// ensure that it is properly memoized with `useMemo` or the React Compiler.
const nodeViewComponents = {
  paragraph: Paragraph,
};

function ProseMirrorEditor() {
  return (
    <ProseMirror
      defaultState={EditorState.create({ schema, plugins: [reactKeys()] })}
      nodeViewComponents={nodeViewComponents}
    >
      <ProseMirrorDoc />
    </ProseMirror>
  );
}
```

If your node view component is more complex, and the top level DOM element does
not directly render `children`, use `ref` and `nodeProps.contentDOMRef`
separately:

```tsx
function FancyParagraph({ children, nodeProps, ref, ...props }) {
  const onClick = useEditorEventCallback((view) =>
    view.dispatch(view.state.tr.deleteSelection())
  );

  return (
    <div
      {...props}
      className={cx(props.className, "fancy-paragraph")}
      ref={ref}
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      <p ref={nodeProps.contentDOMRef}>{children}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## API

### `ProseMirror`

```tsx
type ProseMirror = (
  props: DirectEditorProps &
    ({ defaultState: EditorState } | { state: EditorState }) & {
      children: ReactNode;
      nodeViewComponents?: {
        [nodeType: string]: ComponentType<NodeViewComponentProps>;
      };
      nodeViews?: {
        [nodeType: string]: NodeViewConstructor;
      };
      markViewComponents?: {
        [markType: string]: ComponentType<MarkViewComponentProps>;
      };
      markViews?: {
        [markType: string]: MarkViewConstructor;
      };
    }
) => JSX.Element;
```

Renders the ProseMirror editor.

Example usage:

```tsx
import { EditorState } from "prosemirror-state";
import {
  ProseMirror,
  ProseMirrorDoc,
  reactKeys,
} from "@handlewithcare/react-prosemirror";

export function ProseMirrorEditor() {
  return (
    <ProseMirror
      defaultState={EditorState.create({ schema, plugins: [reactKeys()] })}
    >
      <ProseMirrorDoc />
    </ProseMirror>
  );
}
```

### `ProseMirrorDoc`

```tsx
type ProseMirrorDoc = (props: { as?: ReactElement }) => JSX.Element;
```

Renders the actual editable ProseMirror document.

This **must** be passed as a child to the `ProseMirror` component. It may be
wrapped in any other components, and other children may be passed before or
after.

Example usage:

```tsx
import { EditorState } from "prosemirror-state";
import {
  ProseMirror,
  ProseMirrorDoc,
  reactKeys,
} from "@handlewithcare/react-prosemirror";

export function ProseMirrorEditor() {
  return (
    <ProseMirror
      defaultState={EditorState.create({ schema, plugins: [reactKeys()] })}
    >
      <ToolBar />
      <SomeWrapper>
        <ProseMirrorDoc as="article" />
      </SomeWrapper>
      <Footnotes />
    </ProseMirror>
  );
}
```

### `useEditorState`

```tsx
type useEditorState = () => EditorState | null;
```

Provides access to the current EditorState value.

### `useEditorEventCallback`

```tsx
type useEditorEventCallback = <T extends unknown[]>(
  callback: (view: EditorView | null, ...args: T) => void
) => void;
```

Returns a stable function reference to be used as an event handler callback.

The callback will be called with the EditorView instance as its first argument.

This hook is dependent on both the `EditorContext.Provider` and the
`LayoutGroup`. It can only be used in a component that is mounted as a child of
both of these providers.

### `useEditorEventListener`

```tsx
type useEditorEventListener = <EventType extends DOMEventMap>(
  eventType: EventType,
  listener: (view: EditorView, event: DOMEventMap[EventType]) => boolean
) => void;
```

Attaches an event listener at the `EditorView`'s DOM node. See
[the ProseMirror docs](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#view.EditorProps.handleDOMEvents)
for more details.

### `useEditorEffect`

```tsx
type useEditorEffect = (
  effect: (editorView: EditorView | null) => void | (() => void),
  dependencies?: React.DependencyList
) => void;
```

Registers a layout effect to run after the EditorView has been updated with the
latest EditorState and Decorations.

Effects can take an EditorView instance as an argument. This hook should be used
to execute layout effects that depend on the EditorView, such as for positioning
DOM nodes based on ProseMirror positions.

Layout effects registered with this hook still fire synchronously after all DOM
mutations, but they do so _after_ the EditorView has been updated, even when the
EditorView lives in an ancestor component.

Example usage:

```tsx
import { useRef } from "react"
import { useEditorEffect } from "@handlewithcare/react-prosemirror"

export function SelectionWidget() {
  const ref = useRef()

  useEditorEffect((view) => {
    if (!view || !ref.current) return

    const viewClientRect = view.dom.getBoundingClientRect()
    const coords = view.coordsAtPos(view.state.selection.anchor))

    ref.current.style.top = coords.top - viewClientRect.top;
    ref.current.style.left = coords.left - viewClientRect.left;
  })

  return (
    <div
      ref={ref}
      style={{
        position: "absolute"
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

### `NodeViewComponentProps`

```tsx
interface NodeViewComponentProps extends AllHTMLAttributes<HTMLElement> = {
  nodeProps: {
    decorations: readonly Decoration[];
    innerDecorations: DecorationSource;
    node: Node;
    getPos: () => number;
    contentDOMRef: Exclude<Ref<any>, null>;
  };
  ref: LegacyRef<any>;
};
```

The props that will be passed to all node view components. These props map
directly to the arguments passed to
[`NodeViewConstructor` functions](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#view.NodeViewConstructor)
by the default ProseMirror EditorView implementation.

Node view components may also be passed _any_ other valid HTML attribute props,
and should pass them through to their top-level DOM element.

In addition to accepting these props, all node view components _must_ pass their
ref to their top-level DOM element. All node view components that render their
`children` _must_ pass `nodeProps.contentDOMRef` to the parent element of
`children`.

[See the above example](#building-node-views-with-react) for more details.

### `useEditorStateSelector`

```ts
type useEditorStateSelector<Result> = (selector: (state: EditorState) => Result): Result
```

Select a piece of the EditorState, a la Redux’s `useSelector`.

This hook will only trigger a re-render of the consuming component if the return
value of the selector changes.

The provided selector must return the same value when it receieves the same
inputs. If the selector creates and returns a new object when it runs, you'll
enter a rerender loop.

### `useNodePos`

```ts
type useNodePos = () => number;
```

Like prosemirror-view’s `NodeViewConstructor` API, React ProseMirror passes a
`getPos` function to all node view components. This function will return the
current position of the node in the document.

`getPos` is guaranteed to always return the correct value for the current node,
but it will not subscribe a node view component to updates to its position. This
means that _it is only safe to use `getPos` in a callback or effect_. It is
_not_ safe to use in a render function, because changes to the node's position
will not trigger a re-render of the node view component.

It’s best to avoid relying on the node’s position in the render function,
because that will require that your node view component re-render on every
update to the document. But if you have an infrequently used node, or small
enough documents that you don't have to worry about this, you can use the
`useNodePos` function to get an up-to-date node position after every document
update.

### `useStopEvent`

```tsx
type useStopEvent = (stopEvent: (this: NodeView, view: EditorView, event: Event) => boolean): void
```

This hook can be used within a node view component to register a
[stopEvent handler](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#view.NodeView.stopEvent).
Events for which this returns true are not handled by the editor.

### `useIgnoreMutation`

```tsx
type useIgnoreMutation = (ignoreMutation: (this: NodeView | MarkView, view: EditorView, mutation: ViewMutationRecord) => boolean): void
```

This hook can be used within a node view or mark view component to register an
[ignoreMutation handler](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#view.NodeView.ignoreMutation).
Mutations for which this returns true are not handled by the editor.

### `useSelectNode`

```tsx
type useSelectNode = (selectNode: () => void, deselectNode?: () => void): void
```

This hook can be used within a node view component to register
[selectNode and deselectNode handlers](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#view.NodeView.selectNode).
The selectNode handler will only be called when a NodeSelection is created whose
node is this one.

### `useIsNodeSelected`

```tsx
type useIsNodeSelected = (): boolean
```

This hook can be used within a node view component to subscribe to a boolean
value determining whether this node is selected. The hook will return true when
a NodeSelection is created whose node is this one.

### `useIsComposingIn`

```tsx
type useIsComposingIn = (): boolean
```

This hook can be used within a node view component to subscribe to a boolean
value determining whether an IME composition is active inside the node.

### `widget`

```ts
type widget = (
  pos: number,
  component: ForwardRefExoticComponent<
    RefAttributes<HTMLElement> & WidgetComponentProps
  >,
  spec?: ReactWidgetSpec
) => Decoration(pos, pos, new ReactWidgetType(component, spec))
```

Like ProseMirror View's `Decoration.widget`, but with support for React
components.

### `reorderSiblings`

A [command](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#state.Command) creator that can be
used to reorder adjacent nodes in a document. The command creator takes two
arguments:

- `pos` — The `start` position of the parent of the nodes being reordered
- `order` — The new order for the nodes, expressed as an array of indices. For
  example, to swap the first two nodes in a set of three, `order` would be set
  to `[1, 0, 2]`. To move the first node to the end, and keep the other two in
  relative order, set `order` to `[1, 2, 0]`.

```ts
type reorderSiblings = (pos: number, order: number[]): Command
```

#### When should I use this?

In order to maintain the React state across node view components, React
ProseMirror uses the `reactKeys` plugin to track node positions across
transactions and provide them with stable keys. During a reorder, for example
when two nodes are swapped, ProseMirror is unable to track the positions across
the resulting delete and insert steps, and so the `reactKeys` plugin will assign
new keys to the nodes, causing their node view components to be remounted.

Sometimes, such as when using a drag-and-drop library like `framer-motion`,
remounting the component being dragged can cause issues. The `reorderSiblings`
command provides additional metadata to React ProseMirror that allows it to
properly track the new positions for the reordered nodes, allowing it to reuse
the same keys. This prevents any issues that could be caused by unexpected
component remounts.
