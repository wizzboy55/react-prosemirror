 * Effects can take a Tiptap Editor instance as an argument.
 * This hook should be used to execute layout effects that
 * depend on the Editor, such as for positioning DOM
 * nodes based on ProseMirror positions.
 *
 * Layout effects registered with this hook still fire
 * synchronously after all DOM mutations, but they do so
 * _after_ the Editor has been updated, even when the
 * Editor lives in an ancestor component.
 *
 * This hook can only be used in a component that is mounted
 * as a child of the TiptapEditorView component, including
 * React node view components.
